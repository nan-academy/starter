# Structures

## Object

This exercise is about structuring multiple values together.

### Data Structures: Objects

In JS, `Object` are the most basic data structures, they are a way to group
values together.

They are like a bag of values.

#### Example

Remember that they are different types of variables:

```js
let currency = 'EURO'
let amount = 77.5
let cashPayment = false
```

Now we can group them all in an **object**, as objects are values too, let's
assign one to a `transaction` variable:

```js
let transaction = {
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
}
console.log(transaction) // will show the object transaction
```

The variable `transaction` is declared and its value type is an object.

Let's explain each parts:

#### Object litteral syntax: `{}`

Starting with curly brackets `{}`, they are the delimiters of our object.

```js
let empty = {} // an empty object
```

#### Properties

They define what we want inside our objects. They are composed of two elements:

- a `key`
- and a `value`

```js
//                 ↙ begining of the declaration
let transaction = {
  //  ↙ property key
  currency: 'EURO',
  //           ↖ property value
}
// ↖ end of the declaration
```

We separate them with a `:`, to simplify, we will only use valid identifiers as
keys at the moment.

Each properties must be separated with a `,`

> Note that it's easier to always add a trailing `,` on every properties, but it
> is not required for the last property.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `human` which has a value **an object** with 3 properties:

- a `name` property of your name as a `String`
- an `age` property of your age as a `Number`
- a `secureLuggage` of a `Boolean` saying if your luggage contain dangerous
  things or not. _(still, for obvious security reasons)_

> “I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.” \
> ― Pablo Picasso

### Tests

#### variable `human` is declared and of type object

```js
equal(typeof human, 'object')
```

#### property `name` from `human` is of type string

```js
equal(typeof human.name, 'string')
```

#### property `age` from `human` is of type number

```js
equal(typeof human.age, 'number')
```

#### property `secureLuggage` from `human` is of type boolean

```js
equal(typeof human.secureLuggage, 'boolean')
```

Well, that much is obvious, you can't see memory Pablo...

## Access 🔑

Now that we know how to define objects, let's start to use them

### The dot opperator `.` (property accessor)

Let's start with getting values from them. Well, turns out you already have been
doing it a lot, remember `console.log` ?

The `.` here is _accessing_ the property `log` from the `console` object.

Taking the previous example `transaction` object, we can access properties from
it using `.` same way we got the `log` function:

```js
let transaction = {
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
}

console.log(transaction) // Will log the whole transaction
console.log(transaction.amount) // will only log the amount of the transaction
```

Accessing a property with `.` only give you it's value, and because it is a
value you can use it like any other values:

```js
let taxes = 1.2 // let's define 20% taxes
let transaction = {
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
}

const totalWithTaxes = transaction.amount * taxes

console.log(totalWithTaxes) // will log 93 (77.5 * 1.2)
```

### Instructions

We will provide a `human` variable of type object just like the one you did in
the previous exercise

Your job will be to decompose each property in its own variable:

- define a `name` variable with the value of the `name` property of the `human`
  variable
- same for `age`
- and same for `secureLuggage`

### Tests

#### all 3 variable should be defined and have the right values

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Freddy',
  age: 27,
  secureLuggage: false,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

#### value should also work for Jean-Pierre

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Jean-Pierre',
  age: 65,
  secureLuggage: true,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

## Alter Ego 🎭

You can change your objects in multiple ways:

- modify values of properties
- add new properties
- delete properties

### Modifying objects

Let's declare an object

```js
// we create our object with 2 properties
const user = {
  points: 0,
  code: '75lai78wn',
}
```

#### Adding a new properperty

```js
user.name = 'Martin' // we add a name to our user
```

The syntax is very similar to modifying a variable, the only difference is we
start **from** our user and use the `.` _(property accessor operator)_

#### Changing a property value

```js
user.points = 10 // set points to 10 points
```

The syntax is the same, if the property already exist, its value will be changed
!

#### Removing a property

```js
user.code = undefined // remove the value from a property
```

The trick here is to set its value to `undefined` as this will clear the value
of our property

### Instructions

Modify the provided `alterEgo` variable:

- add a `self` property with the string value `'altered'`.
- add a `fullName` property that is the joined value of `alterEgo`'s properties
  `firstName` and `lastName` with a space in between.
- add `10` to it's `points` property

### Tests

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Edmon Dantes`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 247,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 257,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Edmond Dantes',
})
```

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Viktor Vaughn`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 123,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 133,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Viktor Vaughn',
})
```

## Nested Objects

Since objects are values, nothing stops you from having objects inside objects.

This is very common and allows to model more complex things.

### Instructions

Create an object `address` with 3 properties:

- `city` property with a value of type `String`
- `postcode` property with a value of type `Number`
- `street` property with a value of type `Object` and 2 properties:
  - `name` property with a value of type `String`
  - `number` property with a value of type `Number`

### Tests

#### `address` and it's `street` property are objects

```js
equal(typeof address, 'object')
equal(typeof address.street, 'object')
```

#### all `address` properties have the correct types

```js
equal(typeof address.city, 'string')
equal(typeof address.postcode, 'number')
equal(typeof address.street.name, 'string')
equal(typeof address.street.number, 'number')
```

## The Four Seasons

Sometimes we don't need a key, we just want a list of things, JS has a special
type for that

### Arrays

Let's see an example of an `Array`:

```js
let numberArray = [
  10, // <- no keys !
  20,
  30,
  40,
]

// or for brievety, we often write them on a single line like so:
let numberArray = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

`Arrays` are like objects but use `[]` square bracket delimiters and only
specify values.

The `key` of an element of an array is its position, starting from `0`. We call
that its `index`

So our `numberArray` is **roughly equivalent** to writing this object:

```js
let numberObject = {
  0: 10,
  1: 20,
  2: 30,
  3: 40,
}
```

### Instructions

You must declare a variable `seasons` of an `Array` contains 4 strings, one for
each seasons.

Starting with Spring, like the work of the Maestro Vivaldi.

> BGM:
> [Antonio Vivaldi - Le Quattro Stagioni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4YNYf39mcg)

### Tests

#### `seasons` variable must be an `Array`

```js
if (!Array.isArray(seasons)) {
  throw Error('Season must be an Array')
}
```

#### `seasons` first element must be spring

```js
equal(seasons[0].toLowerCase(), 'spring')
```

#### `seasons` second element summer

```js
equal(seasons[1].toLowerCase(), 'summer')
```

#### `seasons` third element autumn

```js
equal(seasons[2].toLowerCase(), 'autumn')
```

#### `seasons` fourth element winter

```js
equal(seasons[3].toLowerCase(), 'winter')
```

#### `seasons` we must not have a fifth element

```js
equal(seasons[4], undefined)
```

## 3 Directions

### Accessing an array value `[index]`

Since numbers are not valid identifiers we can not use the `.` operator to
access a value in an array, but we can use the `[index]` square brackets to
access a value.

Example:

```js
let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40]
console.log(numberList[0]) // -> 10
console.log(numberList[3]) // -> 40
console.log(numberList[6]) // -> undefined
```

Since we start at `0`, `[0]` will get the value at the first index.

> note that if we try to access an element that doesn't exist we will get
> `undefined` as a value, just like non existing properties for an object.

#### Using the `.length` property

Another difference of the arrays is that they always keep track of how many
elements are inside them.

You can use the `.length` property to get this value:

```js
console.log([].length) // -> 0
console.log([1].length) // -> 1
console.log([1, 1, 1, 1].length) // -> 4
```

### Instructions

We provide you a variable `list` that contains some elements, you will have to
access them and assign their values to variables:

- a variable `first` of the first element of the `list`
- a variable `last` of the last element of the `list`
- a variable `kiss` of an array of 2 elements, the last and the first element of
  the `list`, in that order.

>     🧑‍🎤 ............ Oh, ........... 🧑‍🎤
>     🎶 .. I wanna be last, yeah ... 🎶
>     🎵 . Baby let me be your last . 🎵
>     ✨ ... Your last first kiss ... ✨
>     ― One Direction

### Tests

#### `first` is the value of the first element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(first, 'Harry Styles')
```

#### `first` is the value of the first element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(first, '2011 - Up All Night')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(last, 'Louis Tomlinson')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(last, '2015 - Made in the A.M.')
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first`

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['Louis Tomlinson', 'Harry Styles'])
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first` even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['2015 - Made in the A.M.', '2011 - Up All Night'])
```

## Swapy

Like we did with `Objects`, we can modify our arrays.

### replacing an `Array` value

Let's look at an example of code:

```js
let weekDays = [
  'Monday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]

// Let's say I don't want Monday but a Second Sunday
weekDays[0] = 'Second Sunday'
```

In this example, we select the element at index `0` (with `weekDays[0]`) and
then assign it using the `=` (assign operator) the value `'Second Sunday'`

Now my array look like this:

```js
[
  'Second Sunday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]
```

### Instructions

- You must replace the third element of the provided `replaceMe` array by the
  string `'great'`

Example:

```js
let replaceMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']
//    expect -> ['pif','paf','great']
```

- You must swap the first and second element of the provided `swapMe` array.

Example:

```js
let swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']
// expect -> ['paf','pif','pom'] (last element is untouched)
```

> You must modify the `swapMe` array, not create a new one !

### Tests

#### `replaceMe` third element is `'great'`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(replaceMe, ['This', 'is', 'great', '!'])
```

#### 1st and 2nd elements of `swapMe` are swapped `pif,paf,pom`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(swapMe, ['paf', 'pif', 'pom'])
```

#### 1st and 2nd elements of `swapMe` are swapped `bim,bam,boom`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['bim', 'bam', 'boom']

// Your code

equal(swapMe, ['bam', 'bim', 'boom'])
```

## Mixed Feelings

Unlike feelings, mixed data can be great !

### Mixed data types

Like objects, arrays are values and so you can have arrays of arrays, or arrays
of objects, or arrays of objects with arrays in them or... well, you get the
picture.

### Instructions

You must create a `mixedFeelings` variable that is an array of 3 _emotions_.

An emotion is an object with 2 properties:

- a `type` property of value being one of the following strings `'happiness'`,
  `'sadness'`, `'disgust'`, `'fear'`, `'surprise'` or `'anger'`
- a `level` property of value being a number from `0-9`

### Tests

#### `mixedFeelings` must be an array

```js
if (!Array.isArray(mixedFeelings)) throw Error('not an array')
```

#### `mixedFeelings` must have 3 elements

```js
equal(mixedFeelings.length, 3)
```

#### every elements of `mixedFeelings` must be valid _emotions_

```js
const types = ['happiness', 'sadness', 'disgust', 'fear', 'surprise', 'anger']

for (const emotion of mixedFeelings) {
  if (!types.includes(emotion.type)) throw Error('emotion type is unknown')
  if (emotion.level > 9) throw Error('emotion level is to strong !')
  if (emotion.level < 0) throw Error('negative emotion level is not acceptable')
  if (typeof emotion.level !== 'number' || Number.isNaN(emotion.level)) {
    throw Error('emotion level must be a number')
  }
}
```

### String as keys

So far we only used `identifiers` as keys for our `Objects`, but they are more
flexible than variables as you can use **any** strings you want !

#### Declaring objects with `strings` as `keys`

When we want to use `Strings` that is not a valid `identifier` we must add
string delimiters:

```js
let usingIdentifier = { 'valid': true }
let usingString = { valid: true } // they are the same
```

But this syntax allow us more flexibility, if we need it:

```js
let usingSpace = {
  'Still valid !': true,
  "double quotes works too": 1337,

  // but be careful:
  `backtick quote DO NOT WORK !`: false,
  // because of placeholders, they can not be used as easly :(
  // we will see a way to make that work later on :)
}
```

Has we can see, here in usingSpace, I have 2 spaces and a special character, but
that still works, handy !

#### Accessing properties with `strings` as `keys`

And the most usefull one is actually to access properties values using strings
as keys, for that, much like when we wanted to use a number to access a property
in our arrays, we use `[value]` _(square brackets)_:

```js
let usingSpace = { 'Still valid !': true }

console.log(usingSpace['Still valid !']) // true !
```

#### Assigning a properties value with `strings` as `keys`

Much like arrays too, no surprise here:

```js
usingSpace['New key form string'] = 55
```

It's the same old recipe, we access + use the `=` _(assign operator)_ to set the
value.

### Instructions

Now that your are a true **Keymaker** you have a few tasks to do to assert your
power.

- declare an object `whiteRabbit` with a key that is the rabbit emoji 🐰 with
  the value of your choosing
- declare a variable `traitor` that contains the value from the property
  `'Mr. Reagan'` of the provided `secretData` object

> Another way. Always another way. \
> ― The Keymaker

### Tests

#### `whiteRabbit` is declared and is an object

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
if (typeof whiteRabbit !== 'object') throw Error('whiteRabbit is not declared')
```

#### `whiteRabbit` keys includes the rabbit emoji

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
if (!('🐰' in whiteRabbit)) throw Error('I could not follow the 🐰')
```

#### `traitor` value match `secretData` `'Mr. Reagan'` property

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
equal(traitor, 'Cypher')
```

#### `traitor` value still match `secretData` `'Mr. Reagan'` property

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cool stache' }
// Your code
equal(traitor, 'Cool stache')
```

## Half a million

### Using variables as keys

One possible and very useful way to get something from an object is using a
variable value. Sometimes you don't know in advance what the key will be.

Using variables allows your code to be flexible, let's see how to do it

```js
let greeting = 'hello'
let say = { hello: 'my friend', hoy: 'mate' }

// Here when we access it will use
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'my friend'

// It is exactly the same as doing
console.log(say['hello']) // -> 'my friend'

// But if we change the value of our variable:
greeting = 'hoy'

// The same code now returns another value
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'mate'
```

We are using the `value` of the variable, not the `identifier` to access the
property, so:

```js
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'mate'
console.log(say['greeting']) // -> undefined
console.log(say.greeting) // -> undefined
// greeting is the identifier, but we use it's value, here `'hoy'`
```

### Instructions

In this exercise, we will do a heist.

Our intel already worked the plan out and we are able to provide you with 2
variables:

- a `vault` object
- a `secret` string

You must use the `secret` value as a key to access the matching value from the
`vault` and assign it to a variable `loot`.

You must then replace the value from the vault by a message of your choice.

> I sure hope you didn't do anything stupid, Jackie. \
> ― Ray Nicolette

### Tests

#### You must retrieve `'1/2 MM $'` from the `vault` using the `secret`

```js
let secret = '53CR37-k0D3'
let vault = { '53CR37-k0D3': '1/2 MM $' }
// Your code
equal(loot, '1/2 MM $')
```

#### You must retrieve `500000` from the `vault` using the `secret`

```js
let secret = '53(.-3T /<o|)3'
let vault = { '53(.-3T /<o|)3': 500000 }
// Your code
equal(loot, 500000)
```

#### You must change the value of the vault

```js
let secret = '53CR37-k0D3'
let vault = { '53CR37-k0D3': '1/2 MM $' }
// Your code
if (vault['53CR37-k0D3'] === '1/2 MM $') {
  throw Error('vault value was not changed')
}
```

## 🌟 Parenting 👨‍👧

You are now beginning **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / weird aspects of the
language.

**Only spend time on those if you are ahead !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Circular Structure

We call a circular Structure when an object has a property which value is
itself.

### Instructions

You will make such circular structure by representing a `parent` / `child`
relationship.

Declare 2 variables of objects:

- The object `parent` with a `child` property of the `child` object
- The object `child` with a `parent` property of the `parent` object

### Tests

#### `parent` and `child` must be declared and

```js
equal(typeof parent, 'object')
equal(typeof child, 'object')
```

#### `parent.child` must be equal to `child`

```js
equal(parent.child, child)
```

#### `child.parent` must be equal to `parent`

```js
equal(child.parent, parent)
```

#### `child.parent.child` must be equal to itself

```js
equal(child.parent.child, child)
```

## 🌟 My House 🏠

One should be aware that copying an objet in Js is not a straightfoward process.
Let's try with an object `mainHouse`. Given what we know, the first instinct
would be to do something like this:

```js
let mainHouse = {
  door: 'blue',
  rooms: {
    bedrooms: 2,
    bathrooms: 1,
  },
}

let sameHouse = mainHouse
```

If we `console.log` both `mainHouse` and `sameHouse` we will obtain exactly the
same output:

```js
console.log(mainHouse) // { door: 'blue', rooms: 3 }
console.log(sameHouse) // { door: 'blue', rooms: 3 }
```

So far, so good. Now, let's get into the issue. Let's paint the door of
`mainHouse` in `red`.

```js
mainHouse.door = 'red'
```

If we `console.log` both `mainHouse` and `sameHouse` we will now obtain:

```js
console.log(mainHouse) // { door: 'red', rooms: 3}
console.log(sameHouse) // { door: 'red', rooms: 3}
```

But wait a second... we just wanted to paint the door of `mainHouse`. What
happened here? Why are both doors painted in red?

Well, unlike primitives that can not changes, _(the number `1` will always be
the number `1`)_ objects can mutate.

You can add, delete and update properties, so if two different variables are
assigned to the same object value, they will both mutate the same object.

We call that a reference, not a copy.

There are multiple ways to copies objects. Understanding the limitations of each
of these ways is very important. Which is why this time, you will have to do a
bit of research...

### Instructions

We will declare the same `mainHouse` seen in the lesson above.

- Declare `acidHouse` which will be a `shallow copy` of `mainHouse`.
- Declare `deepHouse` which will be a `deep copy` of `mainHouse`.

> Not in my house! \
> ― Dikembe Mutombo

### Tests

#### `acidHouse` and `deepHouse` are objects

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'blue', rooms: { bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1 } }

// Your code

equal(typeof acidHouse, 'object')
equal(typeof deepHouse, 'object')
```

#### `acidHouse` is not a reference

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'blue', rooms: { bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1 } }

// Your code

mainHouse.door = 'red'

if (acidHouse.door === 'red') {
  throw Error(
    'when painting mainHouse.door in red, acidHouse.door is painted red too. You did not do a shallow copy',
  )
}
```

#### `acidHouse` is not a deep copy

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'blue', rooms: { bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1 } }

// Your code

mainHouse.rooms.bathrooms = 3

if (acidHouse.rooms.bathrooms !== 3) {
  throw Error(
    'when adding 2 bathrooms to mainHouse, acidHouse did not get 2 extra bathrooms as well, it looks like you did a deep copy instead of a shallow one...',
  )
}
```

#### `deepHouse` is not a reference

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'blue', rooms: { bedrooms: 3, bathrooms: 2 } }

// Your code


// eq(deepHouse, mainHouse)

mainHouse.door = 'red'

if (deepHouse.door === 'red') {
  throw Error(
    'when painting mainHouse.door in red, deepHouse.door is painted red too, you did not do a deep copy',
  )
}
```

#### `deepHouse` is not a shallow copy

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'red', rooms: { bedrooms: 4, bathrooms: 1 } }

// Your code

// eq(deepHouse, mainHouse)

mainHouse.rooms.bathrooms = 3

if (deepHouse.rooms.bathrooms !== 1) {
  throw Error(
    'when adding 2 bathrooms to mainHouse, deepHouse didgot extra bathrooms as well, it looks like you did a shallow copy instead of a deep copy...',
  )
}
```

## 🌟 Virus19 🦠

In the previous lessons you have seen some examples of values reassignement
along the way. Here are two more examples:

```js
let mainHouse = { door: 'blue' }
let acidHouse = { door: 'blue' }

mainHouse = 'destroyed'
acidHouse.door = 'red'
```

First, the object `mainHouse` has been replaced by the string `destroyed`.

Second, the door of `acidHouse` has been repainted with the color `red`.

You will now have to find a way to prevent this... A way of "freezing" your
objects if you will...

[Object.freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze)

### Instructions

Level 4 Alert! A very smart `virus19` has escaped the laboratory! You have 5
mins to fight this virus on two fronts:

- First freeze the object `virus19` so that it cannot mutate!
- Then release the countermeasure by declaring `vaccine` which will be a secure
  copy of the object `antivirus`.

### Tests

#### Freeze the `virus19`

```js
const antivirus = { C8H10N4O: true, C12H22O11: true }
const virus19 = {
  dangerosity: 'extremely dangerous',
  contagiousness: 'contagious',
}

// Your code

if (!Object.isFrozen(virus19)) {
  throw Error('you did not freeze the virus19 properly. It can mutate!')
}
```

#### `vaccine` is an object

```js
const antivirus = { C8H10N4O: true, C12H22O11: true }
const virus19 = {
  dangerosity: 'extremely dangerous',
  contagiousness: 'contagious',
}

// Your code

equal(typeof vaccine, 'object')
```

#### `vaccine` contains the right molecules

```js
const antivirus = { C8H10N4O: true, C12H22O11: true }
const virus19 = {
  dangerosity: 'extremely dangerous',
  contagiousness: 'contagious',
}

// Your code

equal(vaccine, antivirus)
```

#### vaccine is frozen

```js
const antivirus = { C8H10N4O: true, C12H22O11: true }
const virus19 = {
  dangerosity: 'extremely dangerous',
  contagiousness: 'contagious',
}

// Your code

if (!Object.isFrozen(vaccine)) {
  throw Error('you did not secure your vaccine components')
}
```
