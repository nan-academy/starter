# Conditions

## Griswold the Blacksmith ‚öíÔ∏è

Methods and built-in functions are good, but most of the time we have to write
our own logic and the first block for that are **conditions**.

### The `if` keyword

The `if` keyword allows you to run lines of code _only if_ the condition is
right, example:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

### Condition `()`

following our `if` is a `condition` delimited by `()` parentheses,

### Comparaison operators `>`

Inside our condition is a comparaison (using the _greater than_ operator `>`).\
This code `if (age > 48)` reads:

> If age is greater than 48, then do the following code

There are 6 different comparaison opperators:

- `>` _greater than_
- `<` _lesser than_
- `<=` _lesser than or equal_
- `>=` _greater than or equal_
- `===` _equal to_
- `!==` _not equal to_

Every comparaison operator are _like_ functions, they take 2 arguments, one on
the right and one on the left, and returns a boolean value. Either `true`, if
the condition is met, or `false` if it's not.

Since they return value, you can assign them to variables, just like functions
return values:

```js
let age = 5
let ageEqual5 = age === 5 // age is equal to 5
let ageNotEqual5 = age !== 5 // age is not equal to 5
console.log(ageEqual5) // true
console.log(ageNotEqual5) // false
```

But they are commonly used directly inside an `if` condition.

### Scope `{}`

After the condition, a curly brace `{` signal the begining of a scope. The scope
ends at the enclosing `}` a few lines after.

Scopes are a way to group lines of code, this allow us to do multiple lines of
code if a condition is true.

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <-beginning of the scope of the if condition
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
} // <- end of the scope of the if condition
```

### Indentation `..` _(2 spaces)_

Upon writing code inside a scope, it's an important convention to **indent** it.

Indenting is when spaces are added at the beginning of the line, here is an
example of bad code:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
if (age > 48) {
// <- without indentation ! bad bad ! unreadable !!
console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

good code:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <- with indentation, omg so clean, amazing !
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

Indenting add a visual indication that the code is inside a scope, while it's
not strictly necessary for code to work, it will become very important to keep
the code clear.

### Instructions

You are Griswold the Blacksmith, and you must give the list of items the player
can buy with the money he has, here is what you are selling:

- arrows for 3 coins
- boots for 44 coins
- sword for 299.99 coins _(limited offer)_

Declare a `purchasableGoods` array and _conditionally_ push to it all the goods
that the player can buy.

Use `if` conditions and compare the cost of the goods with the provided variable
`playerCoins` that contains the number of coins available to the player.

> You must order elements by price

### Tests

#### if the player can't buy anything, the array should be empty

```js
let playerCoins = 2

// Your code

if (!Array.isArray(purchasableGoods)) {
  throw Error(`purchasableGoods must be declared and an array`)
}

equal(purchasableGoods.length, 0)
```

#### if the player can only buy arrows

```js
let playerCoins = 3

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows'])
```

#### if the player can buy arrows and the boots

```js
let playerCoins = 50

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots'])
```

#### if the player can buy everything

```js
let playerCoins = 299.99

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots', 'sword'])
```

#### if the player can buy everything, and more

```js
let playerCoins = 999

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots', 'sword'])
```

## The True King üëë

### Instructions

If the provided variable `name` is the string `'Arthur'` you must change the
value of the provided variable `excalibur` to `'pulled'`

### Tests

#### if the name is `'Perceval'` excalibur should stay set in stone

```js
let name = 'Perceval'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'set in stone')
```

#### if the name is `'Merlin'` excalibur should stay set in stone

```js
let name = 'Merlin'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'set in stone')
```

#### if the name is `'Arthur'` excalibur should be pulled

```js
let name = 'Arthur'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'pulled')
```

## Seeker of Truth

### Truthy and Falsy

In JS, all values are either **truthy** or **falsy**, this means if used in a
condition, truthy values will validate the condition while falsy values would
not.

Here is the list of falsy values:

- `undefined` and `null`
- the numbers `0` and `NaN`
- the empty string `''`
- and the boolean `false` of course

All other values are truthy, note that empty arrays and empty objects are
truthy, but the empty string is not.

```js
if ('') {
  console.log('Since empty string are falsy, this will never log')
}

if ('hello') {
  console.log('this will always log as the string is not empty')
}
```

### Operator `!`

The `!` (NOT operator) can be used to convert a truthy value to `false` or a
falsy value to `true`.

example:

```js
let money = 0
let noMoney = !money

console.log(noMoney) // true
```

In this case, 0 is falsy, so the `!` return the value `true`

### Instructions

Seek the truth and claim your verdict !

- Log `'The truth was spoken.'` if the value of the provided variable `truth` is
  truthy
- Log `'Lies !!!!'` if the value of the provided variable `truth` is falsy

### Tests

#### Test with the falsy value `0`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = 0

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `NaN`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = NaN

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `undefined`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = undefined

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `null`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = null

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `''`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = ''

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `false`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = false

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `'Sure'`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = 'Sure'

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `[]`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = []

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `{}`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = {}

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `true`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = true

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `-0.1`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = -0.1

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

## Special Promo üéüÔ∏è

### `&&` (the AND operator)

This operator is used to group conditions:

```js
if (user.role === 'admin' && user.available === 'now') {
  console.log('Admin', user.name, 'is available and will help you now !')
}
```

Here, the code will only show the message if **both** conditions are true.

### Instructions

Your traveling company have a new special promo for members between 18 and 25
years old.

Write the `if` condition that will check if the user can benefit the promotion:

- `user.age` must be at least `18`
- `user.age` must be lesser or equal to `25`
- `user.activeMembership` must be `true`

If all of those conditions are true, `console.log` the message
`You can benefit from our special promotion`

### Tests

#### Test with a user that can have the promotion

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 22 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'You can benefit from our special promotion')
```

#### Test with a user that is too old

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 33 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that is too young

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 12 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that doesn't have an active membership

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: false, age: 21 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that can have the promotion but is just at the limit

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 25 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'You can benefit from our special promotion')
```

## Time to Pay üí∏

### `||` (the OR operator)

The other way to group condtions:

```js
if (user.role === 'admin' || user.role === 'moderator') {
  console.log(user.name, 'has access to moderation pages.')
}
```

Here, the code will only show the message if **any** conditions are true.

### Instructions

You are selling planes tickets, they all cost `9.99$` you must confirm that the
`customer` has the means to buy this ticket. The `customer` may have enough
`cash` or a `voucher`

Check if the provided variable `customer` can afford the ticket:

- whether he has enough cash (`customer.cash` property)
- or, if he has a voucher (`customer.hasVoucher` property is `true`)

If so, you must increment the provided variable `ticketSold` value by `1`.

### Tests

#### Test with a customer that has enough cash

```js
let ticketSold = 8
let customer = { cash: 20, hasVoucher: false }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 9)
```

#### Test with a customer that has a voucher

```js
let ticketSold = 5
let customer = { cash: 0, hasVoucher: true }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 6)
```

#### Test with a customer that has a voucher and cash

```js
let ticketSold = 6
let customer = { cash: 42, hasVoucher: true }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 7)
```

#### Test with a customer that can not afford the ticket

```js
let ticketSold = 3
let customer = { cash: 3, hasVoucher: false }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 3)
```

## Security

### AND + OR (`&&` + `||`)

Combining `&&` and `||` builds complex logical conditions.

You can use `()` to group them.

### Instructions

The infamous **virus19** is spreading ! As an airport control agent your role is
to ensure that the traveler is safe for his flight.

You must define the `traveler.isImmune` property to `true` if either:

- both `traveler.alreadyHadTheVirus` and `traveler.recovered` are `true`
- or `traveler.isVaccinated` is `true`

otherwise, you must define the `traveler.isImmune` property to `false`

### Tests

#### Test a traveler that is still has the virus

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: true,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, false)
```

#### Test a traveler that has recovered

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: true,
  recovered: true,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```

#### Test a traveler who never had the virus and isn't vaccinated

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: false,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, false)
```

#### Test a traveler that is vaccinated

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: false,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: true,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```

#### Test a traveler that is vaccinated and recovered from the virus

```js
let traveler = { alreadyHadTheVirus: true, recovered: true, isVaccinated: true }

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```

## PHANT0M-WRiT3R üëª

### Using functions in conditions

Any expressions is valid code inside conditions, that includes functions calls:

```js
// for example, we can uppercase to make sure it will match
// no mater if the name has upper or lower letter !
if ('Patrick Lemaire'.toUpperCase() === 'PATRICK LEMAIRE') {
  console.log('This is Patrick')
}
```

### Instructions

Your carreer as a rap ghost writer is at a dead end as inspiration seems to have
left for good, but you still have an ace up your sleeve, you will write a bot
`PHANT0M-WRiT3R` that find ryhmes for you !

- Log the provided variable `word` if it does not start with `'al'` and end with
  `'ion'`

### Notions

- [startsWith](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/startswith)
- [endsWith](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/endswith)

### Tests

#### Tests with `'fermentation'`

```js
let word = 'fermentation'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['fermentation'])
```

#### Tests with `'bathrobe'`

```js
let word = 'bathrobe'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args, [])
```

#### Tests with `'alimentation'`

```js
let word = 'alimentation'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args, [])
```

#### Tests with `'alibaba'`

```js
let word = 'alibaba'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args, [])
```

#### Tests with `'caution'`

```js
let word = 'caution'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['caution'])
```

#### Tests with `'alegation'`

```js
let word = 'alegation'
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args, [])
```

## What else ?

### The `else` keyword

It allows to execute alternative code if the condition do not match:

```js
if (isEnough) {
  console.log('this is enough :)')
} else {
  console.log('I want more !!')
}
```

it is like an `if` but you don't have a condition, just add a scope after `{}`
and write code !

### Instructions

You must check if `'George Clooney'` is included in the provided array `vips`

if he is, `console.log` the string `'What else ?'` otherwhise log
`'The only failure is not to try.'`

### Notions

- [includes](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/includes)

### Tests

#### Test with an empty list

```js
let vips = []
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['The only failure is not to try.'])
```

#### Test if he is not invited

```js
let vips = ['Dora', 'Bruce Willis']
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['The only failure is not to try.'])
```

#### Test if he is in the list

```js
let vips = ['Dora', 'Jacky', 'George Clooney', 'Bruce Willis']
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['What else ?'])
```

#### Test if he is the first in the list

```js
let vips = ['George Clooney', 'Jacky', 'Bruce Willis']
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['What else ?'])
```

## To Infinity And Beyond

### The `else if` keyword

Last keyword of the serie, this one combine the two previous keywords to allow
to chain conditions:

```js
if (temperature < 8) {
  console.log('very cold !')
} else if (temperature < 16) {
  console.log('still too cold...')
} else if (temperature < 24) {
  console.log('getting warmer')
} else if (temperature < 32) {
  console.log('nice :)')
} else {
  console.log('Too hot !!!')
}
```

You can chain as mainy as you want, the syntax is similar to the if.

### Instructions

The year is 2042 Elon's dream came true He now has spaceship lines to mars and
to the moon and a big pool of candidates who all want to go to space but there
is still a heavy selection process based on:

- number `candidate.physicalAptitudes` from `0` to `100`
- boolean `candidate.noFamily`

You have to create a condition to go to Mars which is always the most demanded
destination for this destination:

- if the candidate `physicalAptitudes` are below `80`, he must stay on `'earth'`
- only candidates with `noFamily` can go on `'mars'`
- otherwhise they can still go to the `'moon'`

You must log which planet the `candidate` can access

> And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. \
> ‚Äï Buzz Lightyear

### Tests

#### Weak candidates must stay on earth

```js
let candidate = { noFamily: true, physicalAptitudes: 5 }
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['earth'])
```

#### Strong candadidates without families can go on mars

```js
let candidate = { noFamily: true, physicalAptitudes: 99 }
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['mars'])
```

#### Strong candadidates with a family can go to the moon

```js
let candidate = { noFamily: false, physicalAptitudes: 87 }
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['moon'])
```

#### Even barely strong enough candidates can make it

```js
let candidate = { noFamily: false, physicalAptitudes: 80 }
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['moon'])
```

#### But almost strong enough candidates can not

```js
let candidate = { noFamily: true, physicalAptitudes: 79 }
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['earth'])
```

## Olympic

### Instructions

The Olympic games just ended and you want to tell everyone about the ranking of
your favorite athlete: Pedro.

For the first to the third position, log the matching medal emoji ü•áü•àü•â.
Otherwhise log this disapointed emoji: üòû and a message of his exact ranking.

Example, if pedro is in 10th place, the message to log would be:

```js
'üòû Pedro is #10'
```

### Notions

- [indexOf](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/indexof)

### Hint

Let's keep in mind that the index of a value is **not the same** than its position in an array.
The first position is at index 0.
The second position is at index 1.
The third position is at index 2.
Etc....

### Tests

```js
let athletes = [
  'Maria',
  'Martin',
  'Janine',
  'Bernadette',
  'Jeremy',
  'Sabrina',
  'Kilian',
  'Patrick',
  'Pedro',
  'Seb',
]
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.join(' '), 'üòû Pedro is #9')
```
