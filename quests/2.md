# Structures

## Object

In this exercise is about structuring multiple values together.

### Data Structures: Objects

In JS, `Object` are the most basic data structure, they are a way to group value
together.

They are like a bag of values.

#### Example

Here is an example of the variables we shown you for a transaction:

```js
let currency = 'EURO'
let amount = 77.5
let cashPayment = false
```

Now we can group them all in a an **object**, as objects are values too, let's
assign one to a `transaction` variable:

```js
let transaction = {
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
}
console.log(transaction) // will show the object
```

The variable `transaction` is declared and it's value is an object.

Let's explain each parts:

#### Object litteral syntax: `{}`

Starting with curly brackets `{}`, they are the delimiters of our object

```js
let empty = {} // an empty object
```

#### Properties

They define what we want inside our objects. They are composed of two elements:

- a `key`
- and a `value`

```js
//                 ↙ begining of the declaration
let transaction = {
  //  ↙ property key
  currency: 'EURO',
  //           ↖ property value
}
// ↖ end of the declaration
```

We separate them with a `:`, for simplicity, we will only use valid identifiers
as keys at the moment.

Each properties must be separated with a `,`

> Note that it's easier to always add a trailing `,` on every properties, but
> not required.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `human` with as a value an object with 3 properties:

- a `name` property of your name as a `String`
- an `age` property of your age as a `Number`
- a `secureLuggage` of a `Boolean` saying if your luggage contain dangerous
  things or not. _(still, for obvious security reasons)_

> “I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.” \
> ― Pablo Picasso

### Tests

#### variable `human` is declared and of type object

```js
equal(typeof human, 'object')
```

#### property `name` from `human` is of type string

```js
equal(typeof human.name, 'string')
```

#### property `age` from `human` is of type number

```js
equal(typeof human.age, 'number')
```

#### property `secureLuggage` from `human` is of type boolean

```js
equal(typeof human.secureLuggage, 'boolean')
```

Well, that much is obvious, you can't see memory Pablo...

## Access

Now that we know how to define objects, let's start to use them

### The dot opperator `.` (property accessor)

Let's start with getting values from them, well, turns out you already have been
doing it a lot, remember `console.log` ?

### Instructions

We will provide a `human` variable of an object just like the one you did in the
previous exercise

Your job will be to decompose each property in it's own variable:

- define a `name` variable with the value of the `name` property of the `human`
  variable
- same for `age`
- and same for `secureLuggage`

### Tests

#### all 3 variable should be defined and have the right values

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Freddy',
  age: 27,
  secureLuggage: false,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

#### value should also work for Jean-Pierre

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Jean-Pierre',
  age: 65,
  secureLuggage: true,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

## Alter Ego

You can change your objects in multiple ways:

- modify values of properties
- add new properties
- delete properties

### Modifying objects

Let's declare an object

```js
// we create our object with 2 properties
const user = {
  points: 0,
  code: '75lai78wn',
}
```

#### Adding a new properperty

```js
user.name = 'Martin' // we add a name to our user
```

The syntax is very similar to modifying a variable, the only difference is we
start **from** our user and use the `.` _(property accessor operator)_

#### Changing a property value

```js
user.points = 10 // set points to 10 points
```

The syntax is the same, if the property already exist, it's value will be
changed !

#### Removing a property

```js
user.code = undefined // remove the value from a property
```

The trick here is to set it's value to `undefined` as this will clear the value
of our property

### Instructions

Modify the provided `alterEgo` variable:

- add a `self` property with the string value `'altered'`.
- add a `fullName` property that is the joined value of the `firstName` and the
  `lastName` with a space in between.
- add `10` to it's `point` property

### Tests

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Edmon Dantes`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 247,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 257,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Edmond Dantes',
})
```

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Viktor Vaughn`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 123,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 133,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Viktor Vaughn',
})
```

## Nested Objects

Since objects are values, nothing stops you from having objects inside objects.

This is very common and allow to model more complex things.

### Instructions

Create an object `address` with 3 properties:

- `city` property with a value of type `String`
- `postcode` property with a value of type `Number`
- `street` property with a value of type `Object` and 2 properties:
  - `name` property with a value of type `String`
  - `number` property with a value of type `Number`

### Tests

#### `address` and it's `street` property are objects

```js
equal(typeof address, 'object')
equal(typeof address.street, 'object')
```

#### all `address` properties have the correct types

```js
equal(typeof address.city, 'string')
equal(typeof address.postcode, 'number')
equal(typeof address.street.name, 'string')
equal(typeof address.street.number, 'number')
```

## The Four Seasons

Sometimes we don't need a key, we just want a list of things, JS has a special
type for that

### Arrays

Let's see an example of an `Array`:

```js
let numberList = [
  10, // <- no keys !
  20,
  30,
  40,
]

// or for brievety, we often write them on a single line like so:
let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

`Arrays` are like objects but use `[]` square bracket delimiters and only
specify values.

The `key` of an element of an array is it's position, starting from `0`. We call
that it's `index`

So our `numberList` is roughly equivalent of writing this object:

```js
let numberList = {
  0: 10,
  1: 20,
  2: 30,
  3: 40,
}
```

### Instructions

You must declare a variable `seasons` that contains 4 strings, one for each
seasons.

Starting with Spring, like the work of the Maestro Vivaldi.

> BGM:
> [Antonio Vivaldi - Le Quattro Stagioni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4YNYf39mcg)

### Tests

#### `seasons` variable must be an `Array`

```js
if (!Array.isArray(seasons)) {
  throw Error('Season must be an Array')
}
```

#### `seasons` first element must be spring

```js
equal(seasons[0].toLowerCase(), 'spring')
```

#### `seasons` second element summer

```js
equal(seasons[1].toLowerCase(), 'summer')
```

#### `seasons` third element autumn

```js
equal(seasons[2].toLowerCase(), 'autumn')
```

#### `seasons` fourth element winter

```js
equal(seasons[3].toLowerCase(), 'winter')
```

#### `seasons` we must not have a fifth element

```js
equal(seasons[4], undefined)
```

## Last First Kiss

### Accessing an array value `[index]`

Since numbers are not valid identifers we can not use the `.` operator to access
value in an array, but we can use the `[index]` square brackets to access a
value.

Example:

```js
let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40]
console.log(numberList[0]) // -> 10
console.log(numberList[3]) // -> 40
console.log(numberList[6]) // -> undefined
```

Since we start at `0`, `[0]` will get the value at the first index.

> note that if we try to access an element that doesn't exist we will get
> `undefined` as a value, just like non existing properties for object.

#### Using the `.length` property

Another difference of the lists is that they always keep track of how many
elements are inside them.

You can use the `.length` property to get this value:

```js
console.log([].length) // -> 0
console.log([1].length) // -> 1
console.log([1, 1, 1, 1].length) // -> 4
```

### Instructions

We provide you a variable `list` that contains some elements, you will have to
access them and assign their values in variables:

- a variable `first` of the first element of the `list`
- a variable `last` of the last element of the `list`
- a variable `kiss` of an array of 2 elements the last and the first element of
  the `list`, in that order.

>     🧑‍🎤 ............ Oh, ........... 🧑‍🎤 \
>     🎶 .. I wanna be last, yeah ... 🎶 \
>     🎵 . Baby let me be your last . 🎵 \
>     ✨ ... Your last first kiss ... ✨ \
>     ― One Direction

### Tests

#### `first` is the value of the first element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(first, 'Harry Styles')
```

#### `first` is the value of the first element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(first, '2011 - Up All Night')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(last, 'Louis Tomlinson')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(last, '2015 - Made in the A.M.')
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first`

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['Louis Tomlinson', 'Harry Styles'])
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first` even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['2015 - Made in the A.M.', '2011 - Up All Night'])
```

## Swap

Like `Objects` we can modify our arrays

### replacing an `Array` value

Let's look at an example of code:

```js
let weekDays = [
  'Monday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]

// Let's say I don't want Monday but a Second Sundays
weekDays[0] = 'Second Sunday'
```

In this example, we select the element at index `0` (with `weekDays[0]`) and
then assign it using the `=` (assign operator) the value `'Sunday 2'`

Now my array look like this:

```js
;[
  'Second Sunday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]
```

### Instructions

- You must replace the third element of the provided `replaceMe` array by the
  string `'great'`
- You must swap the first and third element of the provided `swapMe` array.

Example:

```js
['pif','paf','pom'] -> ['paf','pif','pom'] // last element is untouched
```

> You must modify the `swapMe` array, not create a new one !

### Tests

#### `replaceMe` third element is `'great'`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(replaceMe, ['This', 'is', 'great', '!'])
```

#### 1st and 2nd elements of `swapMe` are swapped `pif,paf,pom`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(swapMe, ['paf', 'pif', 'pom'])
```

## Mixed Feelings

Unlike feelings, mixed data can be great !

### Mixed data types

Like, objects, arrays are values and so you can have arrays of arrays or arrays
of objects or arrays of objects with arrays in them or... well, you get the
picture.

### Insctructions

You must create a `mixedFeelings` variable that is an array of 3 _emotions_.

An emotion is an object with a 2 properties:

- a `type` property of value being one of the following strings `'happiness'`,
  `'sadness'`, `'disgust'`, `'fear'`, `'surprise'` or `'anger'`
- a `level` property of value being a number from `0-9`

### Tests

#### `mixedFeelings` must be an array

```js
if (!Array.isArray(mixedFeelings)) throw Error('not an array')
```

#### `mixedFeelings` must have 3 elements

```js
equal(mixedFeelings.length, 3)
```

#### every elements of `mixedFeelings` must be valid _emotions_

```js
const types = ['happiness', 'sadness', 'disgust', 'fear', 'surprise', 'anger']

for (const emotion of mixedFeelings) {
  if (!types.includes(emotion.type)) throw Error('emotion type is unknown')
  if (emotion.level > 9) throw Error('emotion level is to strong !')
  if (emotion.level < 0) throw Error('negative emotion level is not acceptable')
  if (typeof emotion.level !== 'number' || Number.isNaN(emotion.level)) {
    throw Error('emotion level must be a number')
  }
}
```

### String as keys

So far we only used `identifiers` as keys for our `Objects`, but they are more
flexible than variables as you can use **any** strings you want !

#### Declaring objects with `strings` as `keys`

When we want to use a `Strings` that is not a valid `identifier` we must add
string delimiters:

```js
let usingIdentifier = { valid: true }
let usingString = { valid: true } // they are the same
```

But this syntax allow us more flexibility if we need it:

```js
let usingSpace = {
  'Still valid !': true,
  "double quotes works too": 1337,

  // but becareful:
  `backtick quote DO NOT WORK !`: false,
  // because of placeholders, they can not be used as easly :(
  // we will see a way to make that work later on :)
}
```

Has we can see, here I have 2 spaces and a special character, but that still
works, handy !

#### Accessing properties with `strings` as `keys`

And the most usefull one is actually to access properties values using strings
as keys, for that, much like when we wanted to use a number to access a property
in our array's, we use `[value]` _(square brackets)_:

```js
let usingSpace = { 'Still valid !': true }

console.log(usingSpace['Still valid !']) // true !
```

#### Assigning a properties value with `strings` as `keys`

Much like arrays too, no surprise here:

```js
usingSpace['New key form string'] = 55
```

It's the same old recipie, we access + use the `=` _(assign operator)_ to set
the value.

### Instructions

Now that your are a true **Keymaker** you have a few tasks to do to assert your
power

- declare an object `whiteRabbit` with a key that is the rabbit emoji 🐰
- declare a variable `traitor` that contains the value from the property
  `'Mr. Reagan'` of the provided `secretData` object

> Another way. Always another way. \
> ― The Keymaker

### Tests

#### `whiteRabbit` is declared and is an object

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
if (typeof whiteRabbit !== 'object') throw Error('whiteRabbit is not declared')
```

#### `whiteRabbit` keys includes the rabbit emoji

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
if (!('🐰' in whiteRabbit)) throw Error('I could not follow the 🐰')
```

#### `traitor` value match `secretData` `'Mr. Reagan'` property

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cypher' }
// Your code
equal(traitor, 'Cypher')
```

#### `traitor` value still match `secretData` `'Mr. Reagan'` property

```js
let secretData = { 'Mr. Reagan': 'Cool stache' }
// Your code
equal(traitor, 'Cool stache')
```

## Half a million

### Using variables as keys

One possible and very usefull way to get something from an object is using a
variable value. Sometimes you don't know in advance what the key will be.

Using variable allow your code to be flexible, let's see how to do it

```js
let greeting = 'hello'
let say = { hello: 'my friend', hoy: 'mate' }

// Here when we access it will use
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'my friend'

// It is exactly the same as doing
console.log(say['hello']) // -> 'my friend'

// But if we change the value of our variable:
greeting = 'hoy'

// The same code now returns another value
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'mate'
```

We are using the `value` of the variable, not the `identifier` to access the
property, so:

```js
console.log(say[greeting]) // -> 'mate'
console.log(say['greeting']) // -> undefined
console.log(say.greeting) // -> undefined
// greeting is the identifier, but we use it's value, here `'hoy'`
```

### Instructions

In this exercise, we will do a heist.

Our intel already worked the plan out and we are able to provide you with 2
variables:

- a `vault` object
- a `secret` string

You must use the `secret` value as a key to access the matching value from the
`vault` and assign it to a variable `loot`

You must then replace the value from the vault by a message of your choice.

> I sure hope you didn't do anything stupid, Jackie. \
> ― Ray Nicolette

### Tests

#### You must retrieve `'1/2 MM $'` from the `vault` using the `secret`

```js
let secret = '53CR37-k0D3'
let vault = { '53CR37-k0D3': '1/2 MM $' }
// Your code
equal(loot, '1/2 MM $')
```

#### You must retrieve `500000` from the `vault` using the `secret`

```js
let secret = '53(.-3T /<o|)3'
let vault = { '53(.-3T /<o|)3': 500000 }
// Your code
equal(loot, 500000)
```

#### You must change the value of the vault

```js
let secret = '53CR37-k0D3'
let vault = { '53CR37-k0D3': '1/2 MM $' }
// Your code
if (vault['53CR37-k0D3'] === '1/2 MM $') {
  throw Error('vault value was not changed')
}
```

You are now begining **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / wierd aspect of the language.

**Only spend time on those if you are a head !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Circular Structure

We call a circular Structure when an object has a property which value is it
self.

### Instructions

You will make such circular structure by representing a `parent` / `child`
relationship.

Declare 2 variable of objects:

- `parent` with a `child` property with `child` assigned as it's value
- `child` with a `parent` property with `parent` assigned as it's value

### Tests

#### `parent` and `child` must be declared and

```js
equal(typeof parent, 'object')
equal(typeof child, 'object')
```

#### `parent.child` must be equal to `child`

```js
equal(parent.child, child)
```

#### `child.parent` must be equal to `parent`

```js
equal(child.parent, parent)
```
