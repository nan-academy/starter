## Hello There 👋

### Values

There are 3 types of values, and they can model the **WORLD** !\
_(In the end it's all `1`'s and `0`'s for the computer)_, but us, **humans**, need
an easier way of representing stuff.

> We can all agree that `11010001100101110110011011001101111` is not a very
> friendly way to say `'hello'` !

#### Numbers 🔢

- Whole numbers: `1`, `23`, `232139283`
- Negative numbers are prefixed with `-`: `-1`, `-1231`
- Decimal numbers: `3.14`, `-2.53343` etc...

Use them for _quantities_ like in daily life.

#### Booleans ✖️ / ✔️

- Something is `true`
- or `false`

They represent a truth, an answer to a closed-ended question _(anything that can
be answered with yes or no)_:

- Is paris the capital of France ? `true`
- Are you born before 1723 ? `false`
- Is your screen turned on ? `true` _(most likely)_

#### Strings 🆒

- `'Hello'`
- `'This is some text'`

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text, it needs
**delimiters** to define its _begining_ and _end_.\
Delimiters are matching quotes, either `` ` ``, `"` or `'`.

### Using `console.log`

To display output from a script into a console, use the function `console.log`:

```js
console.log() // <- will show an empty line
```

Add any value between the parentheses to see it appear when the script is
executed.

> It is very important to use this often to validate that our code is valid. The
> more it is tested, the easier it is to understand what's going on in the code
> !
>
> In doubt, `console.log` everything, don't be shy, they are for free.

### Instructions

Write a program that displays the exact text `Hello There !`, any `Number` and a
`Boolean`.

### Tests

> Testing your code can be more complicated than your solution. Don't worry, as
> you don't need to understand them.\
> Once you start understanding code a bit, they may clarify what the subject is about.

#### Log a number in the console

```js
// If you see this code, it means that you failed the first tests.
// each tests have it's own code to be tested that will appear if
// your solution doesn't pass it, it is not here to help you.
// While sometimes it may clarify the instructions
// this specific test is complex and will most likely confuse you.

// This is to save all the values that you console.log'd
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// This comment below will be replaced by your code
// Your code

// This is where we check that the value are expected.
// It's pretty advanced code, you don't have to understand it
// Do not try to use it for the solution, it will not help you.
const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map((v) => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('number')) {
  // this is where we create the error message you see:
  throw Error('you must log a number')
  // that's what you should focus on trying to understand
  // the message, not `throw` or `Error` don't worry about
  // that, worry about showing a number in the console !
}
```

#### Log a boolean in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map((v) => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('boolean')) {
  throw Error('you must log a boolean')
}
```

#### Log a string in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map((v) => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('string')) {
  throw Error('you must log a string')
}
```

#### Log the string `Hello There !` in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('Hello There !')) {
  throw Error('you must log the text Hello There !')
}
```

## Anything to Declare ?

### Variables

Values, need a way to be identified, that's why we use variables.\
They add meaning to a value by _pointing_ to it.

It's like a **label**, a way to name things.

If we say `20`, it doesn't carry much meaning, _`20` what ?_

Imagine we are talking about what's in your backpack, you have 20 pairs of
socks.

_Now that's a lot of socks !_

> We defined _what_ we have (pair of socks) and it's _value_ (20)

#### Example

An `identifier` is used to _define_ what it is, using this syntax:

```js
let pairOfSocks = 20
```

> 😱 Woa what's all this ?!

Let's explain each parts:

#### Keyword: `let`

Firstly, a keyword, `let`.

> A `keyword` is a special word that JS knows about, it is used to tell the
> computer to perform a specific action.

`let` that indicate the script that it's defining a new variable.

#### Identifier

After that, it need a **valid** identifier.

In this case it's `pairOfSocks`, we chose what ever we want here that will be
meaningful, _(it's often hard to name things correctly)_.

A few rules to apply to make sure an identifier is valid:

- No space allowed _(`pair of socks` would be 3 distinct identifiers)_
- Not **starting** with a number _(that's reserved for number values)_
- Not being a reserved keyword _(for example using `let`)_
- No special characters

As such we use what's called `camelCase`.

> Note that in JS, it is a convention to not uppercase the first letter as this
> is reserved for special declarations, we won't go into details now.

```js
let pair of socks = 20 // invalid because of spaces
let 'pair of socks' = 20 // invalid because identifiers are not strings
let pair-of-socks = 20 // invalid because of special character -
let pair.of.socks = 20 // invalid because of special character /
let 20PairOfSocks = 20 // invalid because beginning with a number
let PairOfSocks = 20 // valid but incorrect because of the uppercase
let pairOfSocks = 20 // Just right
let let = true // invalid because `let` is a JS keyword
```

#### Operator: `=`

The special character `=` is an **operator**, like in math, they are used to
define specific operations.

In this case, `=` define the `assignation` operation.

It means assigning a value to our variable.

This is what **links** the choosen `identifier` with our `value`.

#### Value

Lastly, a value, like the one you already know: `string`, `number` and
`boolean`.

Full example with descriptive comments:

```js
// ↙ keyword        ↙ assignation operator
let comicBookTitle = 'Tintin in Tibet'
//       ↖ identifier       ↖ the value (here a string)
```

Using multiple variables to define something more complex:

```js
// Example of variables that could represent a transaction:
let currency = 'EURO'
let amount = 77.5
let cashPayment = false

// Use them with console.log, like a normal value:
console.log('You have to pay:')
console.log(amount)
console.log('in')
console.log(currency)
console.log('using cash:')
console.log(cashPayment)
```

### Instructions

All right, before we can embark into this adventure, you are going to tell us
more about yourself using **variables** !

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `age` of a `Number` value of your age

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `name` of a `String` value of your name

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `secureLuggage` of a `Boolean` saying if your
  luggage contain dangerous things or not. _(for obvious security reasons)_

> PS: And please, use reasonable values, or the tests might reject you !

### Tests

#### Create an `age` variable of your age as a number

```js
equal(typeof age, 'number')
```

#### Create a `name` variable of your name as a string

```js
equal(typeof name, 'string')
```

#### Create a `secureLuggage` variable of a boolean

```js
equal(typeof secureLuggage, 'boolean')
```

#### Values must be reasonable

```js
if (age <= 3) {
  throw Error(`You must be over 3 years old to pass this exericse`)
}

if (age > 99) {
  throw Error(`You are too old for this`)
}

if (name.length <= 1) {
  throw Error('Your name must be more than 1 letter long')
}

if (name.length > 99) {
  throw Error('Your name must be less than 99 letters long')
}

if (secureLuggage === false) {
  throw Error(
    `Do you really believe we are going to let you pass with insecure luggage ?!`,
  )
}
```

## An Undefined Future

### Undefined

In previous exercise, you might have encouter `undefined` already.

It's the value of a variable not having a value !

It's saying that the value was not defined.

### Instructions

Find a way to declare a variable `myFuture` without defining its value

Because after all, we don't know what your future holds !

> There's no future \
> No future \
> No future for you \
> ― The Sex Pistols

### Tests

#### `myFuture` must be declared but its value `undefined`

```js
equal(myFuture, undefined)
```

## The Great Escape

### Escaping

**Quote delimiters** can be one of the tricky things to deal with.

Since they are used for delimiting text, they need a trick to include them in
our text.

For example, we want a `'` _(single quote)_ in or text, but use them as
delimiters:

```js
console.log('Houdini once said:')
console.log('Magic is the sole science not accepted by scientists,')
//                    Uh oh... ↙ JS thinks your string ends here
console.log(' because they can't understand it.')
//                       ...and new starts here ↖ that never finish !
// too bad ! a quote, ruined by quotes, ironic and very sad.
```

The `\` _(backslash)_ is used for that:

Everytime there is an _extra special_ character into your string, putting a `\`
in front of it will **escape** it and doing so will let JS understand you meant
the **litteral** following character and not the delimiter, _or whatever else
the character normaly means for a string_

### Instructions

Nothing can stop you now with that new knowledge. Like Houdini, master of
escapes, you are going to escape some strings:

- Create a `escapeFromDelimiters` that includes all 3 quotes _(`` ` ``, `"` and
  `'`)_.

- Create a `escapeTheEscape` that includes a backslash _(`\`)_.

> “How did I escape? With difficulty. How did I plan this moment? With
> pleasure.” \
> ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo

### Tests

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` is declared and includes a double-quote

```js
if (typeof escapeFromDelimiters === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the variable... we've been through this already !`,
  )
}

if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes('"')) {
  throw Error('escapeFromDelimiters must include a double-quote"')
}
```

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` includes a single-quote

```js
if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes("'")) {
  throw Error("escapeFromDelimiters must include a single-quote'")
}
```

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` includes a backtick

```js
if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes('`')) {
  throw Error('escapeFromDelimiters must include a backtick `')
}
```

#### `escapeTheEscape` includes a backslash

```js
if (!new TextEncoder().encode(escapeTheEscape).includes(92)) {
  throw Error('escapeTheEscape must includes a backslash')
}
```

## A String of Number

Distinguishing strings and numbers.

### Instructions

Declare two variables:

- use the identifier `seven` with the value being a string of the number `7`
- use the identifier `seventySeven` with the value being a string of the number
  `77`

> “Number 7 is a legendary number, many great players who have worn it. I hope I
> could do credit in the field with this number.” \
> ― Kylian Mbappé

### Tests

#### As a number, `seven` value is `7`

```js
equal(Number(seven), 7)
```

#### As a number, `seventySeven` value is `77`

```js
equal(Number(seventySeven), 77)
```

#### Somehow, the type of `seven` and `seventySeven` value must be strings

```js
equal(typeof seven, 'string')
equal(typeof seventySeven, 'string')
```

## Redeclaration of Love

### Assign, re-assign

Remember the `let` keyword used to declare new variables.

> Note that we can't have multiple variables with the same identifier otherwise
> JS wouldn't know which one is which.

Redeclaring a variable will crash !

But it is still possible to use the `=` _(assignation operator)_ to change its
value !

### Instructions

The variable `love` has been declared and will be used during the tests.

You must try to re-assign the `love` variable to the string value
`I still love you !!` but without re-declaring it !

> Note that sometimes you may find variable declared with `const`. This means
> that the assignation is constant and can never be re-assigned !
>
> It is used to protect your code against errors, but you can always use `let`
> in its place.
>
> Also you may find online old code using `var`. We are trying to get rid of
> `var`'s since 2015. It's ancient syntax and it was pretty problematic. Never
> use it! If you see code using it, try to find a more recent example. This one
> is outdated.

### Tests

#### The value of `love` must have changed

```js
let love = 'You used to love me !!'

// Your code

equal(love, 'I still love you !!')
```

## Smooth Operator

![sade](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/231748/112029913-a0101900-8b31-11eb-8f59-cd7d68d7269b.jpg)

### Math Operators

They are other operators than assignation, for now let's focus on the one you
probably already know:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Substraction
- `/` Division
- `*` Multiplication

Those operators are used the same way we would write them in math:

```js
console.log(5 + 7) // -> 12
console.log(5 * 5) // -> 25
console.log(7 - 5) // -> 2
console.log(9 / 3) // -> 3
```

Operators are evaluated using classic priority:

```js
console.log(1 + 5 * 10) // -> 51
```

you can use parens `()` to enforce priority:

```js
console.log((1 + 5) * 10) // -> 60
```

And they are resulting in a value, as such they can be assigned to variables:

```js
let halfMyAge = 33 / 2
let twiceMyAge = 33 * 2
```

### Instructions

Your code must use the given variable `smooth` as our initial value

You will declare a few variables:

- `lessSmooth` that is just `1` less than `smooth`
- `semiSmooth` that is the half the amount of `smooth` _(it's still pretty
  smooth)_
- `plus11` that is `smooth` plus `11`
- `ultraSmooth` that is the square of smooth _(now that's smooth !)_

> BGM:
> [Sade - Smooth Operator - Official - 1984](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYv2PhG89A)

### Tests

#### values of the variable are a result of the operations on the variable smooth (`10`)

```js
let smooth = 10

// Your code

equal(lessSmooth, 9)
equal(semiSmooth, 5)
equal(plus11, 21)
```

#### values of the variable are a result of the operations on the variable smooth (`27`)

```js
let smooth = 27

// Your code
equal(lessSmooth, 26)
equal(semiSmooth, 13.5)
equal(plus11, 38)
```

#### ultraSmooth should be the square of the value of smooth (`10`)

```js
let smooth = 10

// Your code

equal(ultraSmooth, 100)
```

#### ultraSmooth should be the square of the value of smooth (`27`)

```js
let smooth = 27

// Your code

equal(ultraSmooth, 729)
```

## Placeholders

Enough about numbers, let's check out what we can do with strings !

### Strings `` `${placeholders}` ``

The first one are `placeholders` for using values inside our strings, they have
there own syntax: `${}`.

#### Example

```js
console.log(`5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15`) // -> 5 + 10 = 15 = 15
```

**Note that it only works using:** the `` ` `` backtick, not the `"` or `'`
quotes.

```js
// here, with the use of quotes instead of backticks, the placeholder is not evaluated and we see it as text:
console.log('5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15') // -> 5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15
```

### Instructions

We will provide a variable `name` and `age`. They will be pre-declared by us.

Declare a `presentation` variable of the string:

> `Hello, my name is` **name** `and I'm` **age** `years old`

But use placeholders to build the string you will put inside `presentation`.  
Put the values of the provided variables `age` and `name` inside those
placeholders.

### Tests

#### `presentation` value includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Patrick'
let age = 48

// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Patrick and I'm 48 years old`)
```

#### `presentation` value still includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Jeremy'
let age = 27

// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm 27 years old`)
```

## Duplicate

Sometimes in life, and in learning, it's important to repeat yourself.

Let's use string placeholders to duplicate a string, so that we can make sure we
get our point across.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `duplicate` that repeat the provided variable `sentence`,
separated by a `, ` and add an ` !` at the end.

> so if sentence would be `Hello there`, we expect `Hello there, Hello there !`.

### Tests

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I told you so'`

```js
let sentence = 'I told you so'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I told you so, I told you so !')
```

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'Not again'`

```js
let sentence = 'Not again'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'Not again, Not again !')
```

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I knew it'`

```js
let sentence = 'I knew it'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I knew it, I knew it !')
```

## 🌟 Unchanging

You are now begining **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / weird aspects of the
language.

**Only spend time on those if you are ahead !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `unchanging` of the value of your choice, but you must make
sure it can not be re-assigned.

### Tests

#### Test to re-assign the value

```js
let originalValue = unchanging
try {
  unchanging = 'new value'
} catch {}

if (unchanging !== originalValue) {
  throw Error('unchanging value changed !')
}
```

#### Test with to re-assign with another value

```js
let originalValue = unchanging
try {
  unchanging = 'another new value'
} catch {}

if (unchanging !== originalValue) {
  throw Error('unchanging value changed !')
}
```
