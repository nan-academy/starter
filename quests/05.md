# Declaring Functions

## What is my purpose?

![robot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/489466992286498816/828181029772197888/butter-purpose.png)

### Remember Methods?

You have seen how to call functions that were stored in object properties.

Remember this example of function call?:

```js
//       ↙ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !') // <- function call happening here
//          ↖ open paren + argument + close paren
```

or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // another function call happening here
console.log(roundedValue) // and another one here
```

There, we saw how to call and use _"pre-declared"_ functions.

Here, now, we are going to learn how to declare our owns. This will gives us
even more freedom to build our own logic.

### Declaring a very basic function

We mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or
an object property.

We will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.

Once a variable is declared; Remember how an array can be recognized with this
syntax : `[]`? or an object with this one : `{}` ?

Well, we will use another syntax for declaring our function. We will do so using
the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax : `() => {}`

- So we first put parens `()`, These, are the containers of the `arguments` that
  go in the function. For now we will leave them empty with no arguments. (More
  on those later on)
- We then add the arrow `=>` which is the distinguishing feature of the
  `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax.
- Finally, we add the curly brackets `{}` to delimite the scope of our newly
  created function. Note: They are not always necessary, you will probably find
  examples of this function syntax without the `{}`. However, for now because
  you are learning. We will put them most of the time.

```js
//    ↙ normal variable     ↙ beginning of the scope of the function
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  //                    ↖ parens () for arguments and the arrow => for syntax
} // <-end of the scope of the function
```

It's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared
function:

```js
myFirstFunction() // nothing happens
```

This function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any
code.

### The scope of a function `{}`

Very much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between
the curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the
scope of our function.

```js
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log('Calling my first function')
  // ↖ some instructions to do when the function is called !
}
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.

```js
myFirstFunction() // "Calling my first function"
```

We actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:

- call another function `console.log()`.

### Instructions

You are a robot made by a scientist called Rick and you want to know your
purpose. We have declared the object `dialogue`. Declare **and call** a function
named `whatIsMyPurpose`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `myQuestion` in
  the object `dialogue`.

Declare **and call** a function named `theAnswer`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `Rick's answer`
  in the object `dialogue`.

Hint : Make sure your console is open if you want to see the actual answer :)

### Tests

#### whatIsMyPurpose is defined and is a function

```js
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function whatIsMyPurpose... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose != 'function') {
  throw Error('whatIsMyPurpose must be a function')
}
```

#### theAnswer is defined and is a function

```js
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

if (typeof theAnswer === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function theAnswer... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof theAnswer != 'function') {
  throw Error('theAnswer must be a function')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPurpose has no arguments

```js
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

if (whatIsMyPurpose.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### theAnswer has no arguments

```js
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

if (theAnswer.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPurpose works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

whatIsMyPurpose()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('What is my purpose?')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: myQuestion')
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el) => el === 'What is my purpose?')
  .length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function whatIsMyPurpose once"`)
}
```

#### theAnswer works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  myQuestion: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.',
}

// Your code

theAnswer()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('You pass butter.')) {
  throw Error(`you must log the value of the key: "Rick's answer"`)
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el) => el === 'You pass butter.')
  .length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function theAnswer once"`)
}
```

## A winning argument

### Arguments

We mentioned it before with methods, functions can take arguments. They are
always in between parens `()`.

Let's use the same examples that we used for function calls:

Remember this example of function call?:

```js
//       ↙ method
console.log('Hello There !') //<-
//                 ↖ The String 'Hello There!' is
//                   the argument of console.log()
```

or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // The number 1.8 is the arg
console.log(roundedValue) // the variable roundedValue is the arg
```

We are now going to adapt `myFirstFuntion` so that it takes one argument :
`arg1`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) => {
  //<-arg1 is inputed in between the parens
  console.log(arg1) // arg1 can be use inside the scope of the function
  //            ↖   arg1 is "transfered" to be the arg of console.log()
} //<-end of the scope of the function
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log(arg1)`.

```js
myFirstFunction('using my first arg') // "using my first arg"
```

But let's say we want to change what the function logs. Now, instead of
modifying `myFirstFunction` we just need to modify the argument in the function
call.

```js
myFirstFunction('another arg') // "another arg"
myFirstFunction('and another one') // "and another one"
myFirstFunction('and one more') // "and one more"
```

### Instructions

You are a general's aide who has to transmit the communications to the other
soldiers.

In order to do so you will create the function `battleCry`. This function will
take one argument and will display it in the console.

The battlefield is big so make sure that the argument is uppercased before
displaying it.

Now, sometimes the communications will have to given quietly.

For this you will create the function `secretOrders` which does the same as
`battleCry` except that it lowercases the argument before sending it.

### Tests

#### battleCry is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof battleCry === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function battleCry... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof battleCry != 'function') {
  throw Error('battleCry must be a function')
}
```

#### secretOrders is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof secretOrders === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function secretOrders... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof secretOrders != 'function') {
  throw Error('secretOrders must be a function')
}
```

#### battleCry has one and only one argument

```js
if (battleCry.length != 1) {
  throw Error('You must use 1 argument for this function, and only one!')
}
```

#### secretOrders has one and only one argument

```js
if (secretOrders.length != 1) {
  throw Error('You must use 1 argument for this function, and only one!')
}
```

#### battleCry shouts properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let orders = {
  shouted: ['attack!', 'you shall not pass!', 'for the horde!'],
  secrets: ['ExEcutE Order 66', 'SILENCE', 'This Is The WAY'],
}

// Your code

orders.shouted.map((el) => battleCry(el))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('ATTACK!')) {
  throw Error(`battleCry('attack!') is not SHOUTING: ATTACK!`)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('YOU SHALL NOT PASS!')) {
  throw Error(
    `battleCry(you shall not pass!) is not SHOUTING: YOU SHALL NOT PASS!`,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('FOR THE HORDE!')) {
  throw Error(`battleCry('for the horde!') is not SHOUTING: FOR THE HORDE!`)
}
```

#### secretOrders whispers properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let orders = {
  shouted: ['attack!', 'you shall not pass!', 'for the horde!'],
  secrets: ['ExEcutE Order 66', 'SILENCE', 'This Is The WAY'],
}

// Your code

orders.secrets.map((el) => secretOrders(el))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('execute order 66')) {
  throw Error(
    `secretOrders('ExEcutE Order 66') is not whispering: execute order 66 `,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('silence')) {
  throw Error(`secretOrders('SILENCE') is not whispering: silence `)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('this is the way')) {
  throw Error(
    `secretOrders('This Is The WAY') is not whispering: this is the way `,
  )
}
```

## Two can play that game

### Arguments (Continued)

We have seen how to add one argument to the a function, We are now going to see
how to add two (or more).

Remember when `arg1` was added in the parens `()`?

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) => {
  console.log(arg1)
}
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('using my first arg') // "using my first arg"
```

Well now, all we need to do to add a second argument `arg2` is to add a comma
`,` after `arg1` and then add `arg2`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2) => {
  //<-arg1 and arg2 are inputed in between the parens
  console.log(arg1, arg2)
  //            ↖   arg1 and arg2 are "transfered" to be the args of console.log()
}
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('first arg', 'second arg')
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
```

For more args, you will need to simply repeat the same process. Example with
`arg3` and `arg4`:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed
  console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('first arg', 'second arg', 3, 4)
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
// 3
// 4
```

Finally, please note that you can name your arguments however you please. Just
make sure that you reuse the proper name inside the scope of your function.
Example:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed
  console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
// "Europe"
// "France"
// "Paris"
// "30°C"
```

### Instructions

You want to conquer the world! (of entertainment).

In this exercise you will have to declare the function `duos`.

This function will take two arguments and will log them together with an `and`
and a `!`

Example: If the `arg1` is `Batman` and `arg2` is `Robin`, the fonction should
log : `Batman and Robin!`

You will then declare the function `duosWork`. This function will take three
arguments and will log them togethers as in the example below. Example: If the
`arg1` is `Batman`, the`arg2` is `Robin`, and the `arg3` is `protect Gotham`.
the fonction should log : `Batman and Robin protect Gotham!`

### Tests

#### duos is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof duos === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function duos... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof duos != 'function') {
  throw Error('duos must be a function')
}
```

#### duos has two arguments

```js
if (duos.length != 2) {
  throw Error('You need two arguments for this function!')
}
```

#### duos combines properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let combinations2 = [
  ['Batman', 'Robin'],
  ['Pinky', 'The Brain'],
  ['Bonnie', 'Clyde'],
  ['Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith'],
]

// Your code

combinations2.map((el) => duos(el[0], el[1]))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('Batman and Robin!')) {
  throw Error(`duos('Batman', 'Robin') is not combining: Batman and Robin!`)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Pinky and The Brain!')) {
  throw Error(
    `duos('Pinky', 'The Brain') is not combining: Pinky and The Brain!`,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Bonnie and Clyde!')) {
  throw Error(`duos('Bonnie', 'Clyde') is not combining: Bonnie and Clyde!`)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Mr. and Mrs.Smith!')) {
  throw Error(`duos('Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith') is not combining: Mr. and Mrs.Smith!`)
}
```

#### duosWork is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof duosWork === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function duosWork... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof duosWork != 'function') {
  throw Error('duosWork must be a function')
}
```

#### duosWork has three arguments

```js
if (duosWork.length != 3) {
  throw Error('You need three arguments for this function!')
}
```

#### duosWork combines properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let combinations3 = [
  ['Batman', 'Robin', 'protect Gotham'],
  ['Pinky', 'The Brain', 'want to conquer the world'],
  ['Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'escape the Police'],
  ['Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith', 'are the greatest spy couple'],
]

// Your code

combinations3.map((el) => duosWork(el[0], el[1], el[2]))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('Batman and Robin protect Gotham!')) {
  throw Error(
    `duosWork('Batman', 'Robin', 'protect Gotham') is not combining: Batman and Robin protect Gotham!`,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Pinky and The Brain want to conquer the world!')) {
  throw Error(
    `duosWork('Pinky', 'The Brain', 'want to conquer the world') is not combining: Pinky and The Brain want to conquer the world!`,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Bonnie and Clyde escape the Police!')) {
  throw Error(
    `duosWork('Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'escape the Police') is not combining: Bonnie and Clyde escape the Police!`,
  )
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('Mr. and Mrs.Smith are the greatest spy couple!')) {
  throw Error(
    `duosWork('Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith', 'are the greatest spy couple') is not combining: Mr. and Mrs.Smith are the geatest spy couple!`,
  )
}
```

## You pass butter

### Return value

We are now going to see how to declare a function that returns an argument.

Let's say we declare the variable `ten` the following way.

```js
let ten = 5 + 5
console.log(ten) // 10
```

We could replace those `5` with a very simple function that `returns` this
result. Let's call this function `returnsFive`. Let's not put any arguments in
this function to keep it very basic. The only new concept is the `return`
keyword. This keyword will return the specified value **and** end the function
execution.

```js
let returnsFive = () => {
  return 5
  //     ↖ the keyword `return`, returns the value right after it,
  //       in this case the number 5.
}
```

Now that the function is declared, we call it where we need it.

```js
let ten = returnsFive() + returnsFive()
console.log(ten) // 10
```

Now a question that you might ask yourself is: What if we had several `return`
keywords in the same function? Well as mentioned before, the `return` also stops
the function execution. So only the first `return` would matter. In fact that
means that anything after the `return` would not be executed. Example:

```js
let returnsFive = () => {
  return 5 //ONLY this return is executed. Everything else is forgoten.
  return 10 // not executed (useless)
  return 'I am useless' // not executed either
  console.log('I am also useless') //nor this one
}
let ten = returnsFive() + returnsFive()
console.log(ten) // 10
//exactly the same result as the previous example
```

As you may see, we get exactly the same result as the previous example.
`returnsFive` only returns 5. :)

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you now know your purpose. (Remember? 'You pass butter.')

Define the function `passButter` that returns `The butter`.

![robot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/489466992286498816/828181031991377930/butter-disapointed.png?width=717&height=241)

### Tests

#### passButter is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof passButter === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function passButter... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof passButter != 'function') {
  throw Error('passButter must be a function')
}
```

#### passButter has no arguments

```js
if (passButter.length != 0) {
  throw Error('You need no arguments for this function!')
}
```

#### passButter returns The butter properly

```js
// Your code

let theTable = passButter()

if (theTable != 'The butter') {
  throw Error(`passButter() did not return 'The butter'`)
}
```

## A new purpose

### Treating data in and out

You know now how to declare the `arguments` and the `return` values of a
function. You know have the tools to:

- receive data in the function (in the form of the arguments)
- treat the data (in the fonction scope)
- return the treated data (with the return keyword)

You can now for example, transform this function which we used right before:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)
} //<- end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
// 'Europe'
// 'France'
// 'Paris'
// '30°C'
```

into:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed

  return `${city} is a city in ${country} in the continent ${continent} where the temperature is of ${temperature} today.`
} //<-end of the scope of the function
//                                         arg       arg      arg      arg
// Now we call the function ↘              in,       in,      in,      in,
let resultOfMyfunction = myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
//           ↖ and out
console.log(resultOfMyFunction) // below, is the log of what the function returned to us.
//  'Paris is a city in France in the continent Europe where the temperature is of 30°C today.'
```

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you want to do something more than just pass the butter. You
want to level up so you decide to take your destiny into your own pliers. You
are going to start slow by competing with calculators.

Define the functions :

- `add2` which adds two arguments and returns the result.
- `sub2` which substract two arguments and returns the result.
- `mult2` which substract two arguments and returns the result.
- `div2` which divides two arguments and returns the result.

### Tests

#### add2, sub2, mult2 and div2 are defined and are functions

```js
if (typeof add2 === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function add2... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof add2 != 'function') {
  throw Error('add2 must be a function')
}

if (typeof sub2 === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function sub2... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof sub2 != 'function') {
  throw Error('sub2 must be a function')
}

if (typeof mult2 === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function mult2... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof mult2 != 'function') {
  throw Error('mult2 must be a function')
}

if (typeof div2 === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function div2... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof div2 != 'function') {
  throw Error('div2 must be a function')
}
```

#### add2, sub2, mult2 and div2 have 2 arguments

```js
if (add2.length != 2) {
  throw Error('You need 2 arguments for this function!(add2)')
}
if (sub2.length != 2) {
  throw Error('You need 2 arguments for this function!(sub2)')
}
if (mult2.length != 2) {
  throw Error('You need 2 arguments for this function!(mult2)')
}
if (div2.length != 2) {
  throw Error('You need 2 arguments for this function!(div2)')
}
```

#### add2 returns the right results

```js
equal(add2(1, 1), 2)
equal(add2(1, 2), 3)
equal(add2(2, 2), 4)
equal(add2(2, 3), 5)
```

#### sub2 returns the right results

```js
equal(sub2(1, 1), 0)
equal(sub2(2, 1), 1)
equal(sub2(3, 1), 2)
equal(sub2(4, 1), 3)
```

#### mult2 returns the right results

```js
equal(mult2(1, 1), 1)
equal(mult2(1, 2), 2)
equal(mult2(2, 2), 4)
equal(mult2(2, 3), 6)
```

#### div2 returns the right results

```js
equal(div2(1, 1), 1)
equal(div2(2, 1), 2)
equal(div2(2, 2), 1)
equal(div2(6, 2), 3)
```

## level up

You know now, in your function declarations, how to use arguments and returns.

Let's try to now use the `if` statements in a new function called `happy`. Here
is an example:

```js
let happy = (mood) => {
  if (mood === 'happy') {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

let result1 = happy('happy')
let result2 = happy('sad')

console.log(result1) //true
console.log(result2) //false
```

Here we used the `if` statement, and two `return` keywords to alternate between
the result `true` or `false` depending whether the argument `mood` is equal to
the string `happy` or not. The possibilities are becoming limitless...

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you are continuing your training to add yourself new ... skills
(I could have said funtions). You want now to become a robot bartender.

Define the function `shaker` which will take as arguments:

- `quantity`, which will be variable of type `Number`
- `fruit`, which will be a `String`
- `alcohol`, which will be a `Boolean`

`shaker` must return a `String`. Look at the examples below to understand how
`shaker` must mix its ingredients:

```js
console.log(shaker(1, 'strawberry', true))
//'1 strawberry cocktail'
console.log(shaker(2, 'chocolate', false))
//'2 chocolate milkshakes'
console.log(shaker(2, 'strawberry', true))
//'2 strawberry cocktails'
console.log(shaker(1, 'chocolate', false))
//'1 chocolate milkshake'
```

Ps: watch out for your plurals!

### Tests

#### shaker is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof shaker === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function shaker... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof shaker != 'function') {
  throw Error('shaker must be a function')
}
```

#### shaker has 3 arguments

```js
if (shaker.length != 3) {
  throw Error('You need 3 arguments for this function!')
}
```

#### shaker is shakin it right.

```js
equal(shaker(1, 'strawberry', true), '1 strawberry cocktail')
equal(shaker(1, 'vanilla', true), '1 vanilla cocktail')
equal(shaker(1, 'mango', true), '1 mango cocktail')
equal(shaker(1, 'strawberry', false), '1 strawberry milkshake')

equal(shaker(2, 'banana', true), '2 banana cocktails')
equal(shaker(2, 'chocolate', false), '2 chocolate milkshakes')
equal(shaker(2, 'vanilla', false), '2 vanilla milkshakes')
equal(shaker(2, 'strawberry', false), '2 strawberry milkshakes')
```

### Instructions

You are now a butter passer, calculator, and barttender all-in-one robot. You
want to keep on improving but you can feel like your memory capacities are
reaching their limits. You will now try to improve what you aready have.

Declare the function `addAll` which will will return the sum of all the
arguments it recieves. Examples:

```js
console.log(addAll(1)) //1
console.log(addAll(1, 10)) //11
console.log(addAll(1, 10, 100)) //111
```

You will then do exactly the same for `subAll`, `MultAll` and `divAll`.

### Tests

#### addAll, subAll, multAll and divAll are defined and are functions

```js
if (typeof addAll === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function addAll... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof addAll != 'function') {
  throw Error('addAll must be a function')
}

if (typeof subAll === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function subAll... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof subAll != 'function') {
  throw Error('subAll must be a function')
}

if (typeof multAll === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function multAll... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof multAll != 'function') {
  throw Error('multAll must be a function')
}

if (typeof divAll === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function divAll... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof divAll != 'function') {
  throw Error('divAll must be a function')
}
```

#### addAll returns the right results

```js
equal(addAll(1, 1), 2)
equal(addAll(1, 2, 3), 6)
equal(addAll(2, 2, 4, 10), 18)
equal(addAll(2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 10), 28)
```

#### subAll returns the right results

```js
equal(subAll(1, 1), 0)
equal(subAll(2, 1, 1, -1), 1)
equal(subAll(10, 3, 1, 4), 2)
equal(subAll(11, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3), -3)
```

#### multAll returns the right results

```js
equal(multAll(1, 1), 1)
equal(multAll(1, 2, 10), 20)
equal(multAll(2, 2, 10, 10), 400)
equal(multAll(2, 3, -2, 10, 10), -1200)
```

#### divAll returns the right results

```js
equal(divAll(1, 1), 1)
equal(divAll(2, 1, 1), 2)
equal(divAll(100, 2, 2, 5), 5)
equal(divAll(1000, 10, 5, 4, 1), 5)
```

### Instructions

With all the you know now you are not a truly happy, efficient and independent
robot.

You have decided that if someone ask you the question `Are you happy?` or
questions that includes the word `happy` you will always says that it is `true`.
To do so you will declare the function `happy` which takes only one argument and
returns a boolean.

Examples:

```js
console.log(happy('Are you happy?')) // true
console.log(happy('Happy?')) // true
console.log(happy('Are you happy!')) // false  -> this is not a question
console.log(happy('Are you sad?')) // false  -> wrong question
```

Any other requests will be denied with a `false`. (if it is not a question of if
it does not have the word `happy`).

And because you aim for efficiency you will contruct your fonction without the
curlys brackets `{}` and without the keyword `return` or `if`.

### Tests

#### happy is defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof happy === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function happy... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}
if (typeof happy != 'function') {
  throw Error('happy must be a function')
}
```

#### happy has 1 argument

```js
if (happy.length != 1) {
  throw Error('You need 1 argument for this function!')
}
```

#### happy is smiling right.

```js
equal(happy('Are you happy?'), true)
equal(happy('Happy?'), true)
equal(happy('Are you sad?'), false)
equal(happy('happy!'), false)
equal(happy('Happy! are we not?'), true)
```

#### happy has no curly braces {}.

```js
if (happy.toString().includes('{')) {
  throw Error('No curly braces {} ! ')
}
if (happy.toString().includes('}')) {
  throw Error('No curly braces {} ! ')
}
```

#### happy has no keyword return.

```js
if (happy.toString().includes('return')) {
  throw Error('No keyword return allowed ! ')
}
```

#### happy has no keyword if.

```js
if (happy.toString().includes('if')) {
  throw Error('No keyword if allowed ! ')
}
```
